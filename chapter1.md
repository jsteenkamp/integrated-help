Keener gunned his motor and flashed his lights. The car slowed to a stop, and Keener walked up to the window. Leaning down, he caught a whiff of marijuana. The young man was black and looked to be in his 20s, with a baseball cap, grey sweatpants, and a tattoo that crept out of his shirt. Keener said, politely but firmly, "I smell what smells like weed to me."

The man said he smoked earlier, but that there was "nothing in the car."

"YOU ASK ME IF I SMOKE. I SMOKE, MAN!"

Keener decided the smell gave him probable cause for a search. He told the young man to step out, frisked him, and asked him if he had anything "I should know about." The man said he had a gun. Keener found a black Glock 23 pistol, .40 caliber, under the seat. He took it back to his car, noticing it had no magazine — just a bullet in the pipe. "Pretty big," Keener said, turning the gun in his hands.

Another police car rolled up behind Keener — a standard call for backup had gone out. Standing between his own car and Keener’s car, the young man stared at the ground, clearly annoyed but also trying not to appear annoyed. When Keener asked about the smell again, he said, "You ask me if I smoke. I smoke, man!"
